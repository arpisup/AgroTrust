# AgroTrust Local Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start - Run AgroTrust Locally

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the AgroTrust blockchain system locally on your machine. No frontend or backend required - everything runs through the command line!

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** (optional, for version control)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd AgroTrust
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Compile Smart Contracts
```bash
npm run compile
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the System Locally

### Step 1: Start Local Blockchain Network

Open a **new terminal window** and run:
```bash
npm run node
```

**Expected Output:**

## üéØ What Just Happened?

### ‚úÖ **Complete GI Product Lifecycle Tracked:**

1. **Batch Creation**: `TURMERIC2025_002` - Erode Turmeric from Tamil Nadu
2. **Farmer Information**: Ravi Kumar from Bhavani, Erode District
3. **Cultivation Details**: 15,000 sq meters, Red Loamy Soil, Drip Irrigation, Organic Neem
4. **Processing**: Traditional Sun Drying at Erode Processing Unit
5. **Lab Testing**: FSSAI certification with quality parameters
6. **GI Certificate**: Official GI certificate from Chennai Registry
7. **Transfer History**: Complete audit trail from farm to distribution
8. **Trace Data**: QR code for consumer verification

### üîç **Key Features Demonstrated:**

- **Immutable Records**: All data is permanently stored on the blockchain
- **Complete Traceability**: From farm to consumer
- **Quality Assurance**: Lab results and certifications
- **Transfer Tracking**: Every handoff recorded with timestamps
- **Consumer Verification**: QR code system for end-user verification

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Interactive Console (Optional)

You can interact with the contract manually using the Hardhat console:

```bash
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```

**Example console commands:**
```javascript
// Get the contract
const AgroTrust = await ethers.getContractFactory("AgroTrust");
const agroTrust = AgroTrust.attach("0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3");

// Check if a batch exists
await agroTrust.checkBatchExists("TURMERIC2025_002");

// Get batch information
const batch = await agroTrust.getBatch("TURMERIC2025_002");
console.log(batch);

// Get farmer information
const farmer = await agroTrust.getFarmerInfo("TURMERIC2025_002");
console.log(farmer);
```

### Run Tests

To verify everything is working correctly:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with gas reporting
npm run test:gas
```

### Create Multiple Batches

To create another batch, edit `scripts/interact.ts` and change the batch ID:
```typescript
const batchId = "DARJEELING2025_001"; // Change this
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run interact:local
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Batch already exists" error**
   - Solution: Change the batch ID in `scripts/interact.ts`

2. **"Cannot find module" errors**
   - Solution: Run `npm install` again

3. **Port 8545 already in use**
   - Solution: Kill any existing Hardhat processes or change the port

4. **BigInt conversion errors**
   - Solution: The script has been fixed to handle BigInt properly

### Reset Everything

To start fresh:
```bash
# Stop the Hardhat node (Ctrl+C)
# Clear cache
npm run clean

# Recompile
npm run compile

# Start over from Step 1
```

## üìä Understanding the System

### What's Happening Behind the Scenes:

- **Smart Contract**: `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`
- **Blockchain**: Local Hardhat network with 20 test accounts
- **Gas Usage**: Each operation costs gas (free on local network)
- **Events**: All operations emit blockchain events for transparency

### Key Components:

1. **AgroTrust.sol**: Main smart contract with all business logic
2. **deploy.ts**: Script to deploy the contract
3. **interact.ts**: Script to demonstrate the complete workflow
4. **test/AgroTrust.ts**: Comprehensive test suite

### Data Flow:
```
1. Batch Creation ‚Üí 2. Farmer Info ‚Üí 3. Cultivation ‚Üí 4. Processing
                                                    ‚Üì
8. Trace Data ‚Üê 7. Transfer Records ‚Üê 6. Certificates ‚Üê 5. Lab Results
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Try These Experiments:

1. **Create another GI product** (Darjeeling Tea, Basmati Rice, etc.)
2. **Query existing data** using the contract functions
3. **Test access control** by trying operations with different accounts
4. **Deploy to testnet** (Sepolia) for real blockchain testing

### Production Deployment:

When ready for production:
1. Configure networks in `hardhat.config.ts`
2. Set up environment variables
3. Deploy to testnet: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia`
4. Deploy to mainnet: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mainnet`
